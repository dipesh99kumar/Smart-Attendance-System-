# Smart-Attendance-System(Face Recognition)

Python project that involves Face Recognition using OpenCV

The main aspect of the  project is to record the students attendance in a more concrete manner through face recognition. This will not only reduce the burden of teachers but also it will ensure fair attendance by unique identity of each person. The attendance is automatically uploaded to the web app and displayed there. The teacher can access the web app to see the attendance record and manage it.
